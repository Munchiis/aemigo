# Privacy Policy for AEMigo

## Introduction

AEMigo is a browser extension designed to streamline workflows for Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) developers, administrators, and content authors. This privacy policy explains how AEMigo handles user data.

## Data Collection and Storage

AEMigo is committed to protecting your privacy:

- **Local Storage Only**: All data used by AEMigo is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API. No data is transmitted to external servers owned by the extension developers.

- **No Analytics or Tracking**: AEMigo does not include any analytics, tracking, or telemetry features. We do not collect usage statistics or monitor how you use the extension.

- **No Personal Data Collection**: The extension does not collect, process, or store personal information beyond what you explicitly enter in the configuration.

## User-Provided Information

AEMigo may store the following information locally in your browser:

- **AEM Environment Configurations**: URLs of your AEM instances (author, publisher, dispatcher)
- **Login Credentials**: If you choose to save login credentials for status checks, these are stored locally in your browser's secure storage
- **Custom Shortcuts and Quick Actions**: Any customizations you make to the extension's functionality

This information is:
- Never transmitted outside your browser
- Only used to provide the extension's functionality
- Completely under your control

## Data Access

The only permissions AEMigo requires are:
- Access to browser tabs and tab groups to manage AEM environments
- Storage permissions to save your configuration locally
- Host permissions to connect to your AEM instances

## Data Removal

To remove all data stored by AEMigo:
1. Open Chrome's extension management page
2. Find AEMigo and click "Remove"
3. Check the option to "Clear data from this extension"

## Third-Party Services

AEMigo interacts only with the AEM instances you configure. Any data exchange happens directly between your browser and your AEM instances. The extension itself does not send data to any third-party services.

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update it in the extension's documentation and provide notification upon update.

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy or AEMigo's data practices, please open an issue on our GitHub repository.
